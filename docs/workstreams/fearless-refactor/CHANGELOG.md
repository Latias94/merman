# Fearless Refactor Changelog

This log records completed changes that materially advance the fearless-refactor workstream.
Detailed planning remains in `TODO.md` and `MILESTONES.md`.

## 2026-05-08

- Moved `xychart` from JSON-fallback rendering to `XyChartDiagramRenderModel`.
- Removed the render-side xychart JSON transport structs; JSON layout compatibility now deserializes
  into the shared core render model before using the typed layout path.
- Routed public `merman::render::render_svg_sync` xychart rendering through the typed render model
  and layout-only SVG emission.
- Added typed-model and public-render regression coverage for xychart.
- Recorded the xychart typed render-path spotcheck in
  `docs/performance/spotcheck_2026-05-08_xychart_typed_render_model.md`.
