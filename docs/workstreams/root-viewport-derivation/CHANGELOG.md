# Root Viewport Derivation Changelog

## 2026-05-11

- Created the workstream document set for replacing State and Mindmap fixture-scoped root viewport
  overrides with typed layout or emitted-bounds derivation where practical.
- Recorded the State/Mindmap baseline counts, focused parity-root audit commands, disabled-root
  diagnostics, and clippy/nextest expectations for future code changes.
- Narrowed State's 72px border-label height inflation to classDef-compiled border styles, removed
  the now-derived `can_have_styles_applied` State root pin, and tightened the root budget to `759`.
- Refreshed the two affected State style layout goldens and verified full State normal DOM,
  full State `parity-root`, render clippy, xtask budget test, and `merman-render` nextest.
- Decoded Mermaid `encodeEntities` placeholders before State layout label measurement, moved the
  remaining `test({ foo: 'far' })` edge-label browser width into State text metrics, removed the
  two now-derived State root pins, and tightened the root budget to `757`.
