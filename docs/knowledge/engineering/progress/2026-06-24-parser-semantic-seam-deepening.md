# Summary

The next fearless-refactor slice targets the parser/semantic seam. Parser technology stays
family-local, but editor-facing consumers now move toward span-rich semantic facts and recoverable
partial parse results instead of raw-text heuristic scans.

# Details

- The current `merman-lsp` baseline remains intact.
- `merman-analysis::FenceTextIndex` is now the shared migration seam for editor-facing fence
  structure. LSP no longer owns separate completion, outline, navigation, and rename scans.
- The LSP snapshot layer now stores the shared index and projects it into protocol types; it does
  not define its own editor semantics.
- Heuristic fence-local structure scans are now a centralized migration shim, not the target design.
- The new plan keeps the parser choice where it already belongs: inside each family.
- A new ADR records the seam so later lint and LSP work can use the same contract.
- Verified with `cargo fmt --all` and `cargo test -p merman-analysis -p merman-lsp`.

# Next Action

Use flowchart as the tracer bullet for parser-backed editor spans. Its lexer already emits byte
locations for tokens, but the AST/model currently drops those spans, so the next change should lift
node/subgraph/reference spans through the family-local parser path before LSP consumes them.
