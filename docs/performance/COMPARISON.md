## Method

- `merman`: `cargo bench -p merman --features render --bench pipeline -- ...`
- `mermaid-rs-renderer` (mmdr): `cargo bench --bench renderer -- ...`
- Filter: "end_to_end/flowchart_medium"
- Sample size: 20, warm-up: 1s, measurement: 1s

## Results (end_to_end, mid estimate)

| benchmark | merman | mermaid-rs-renderer | mermaid-js (puppeteer) | ratio (merman / mmdr) | ratio (merman / mermaid-js) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| end_to_end/flowchart_medium | 5.75 ms | 4.81 ms | - | 1.2x | - |

## Notes

- `merman` is parity-focused (upstream Mermaid SVG DOM gates) and optimized for deterministic alignment.
- `mermaid-rs-renderer` is a different renderer with different goals and coverage; raw performance numbers are not directly comparable to visual/DOM parity.
- Treat these as **local regression tracking** numbers. Always re-run on the same machine/toolchain for meaningful comparisons.

## Skipped (merman)

These fixtures were present but skipped because `merman` returned a parse/layout/render error during the pre-check.

`treemap_medium`, `xychart_medium`
