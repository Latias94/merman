# dugong-graphlib

Graph container APIs used by `dugong` (port of `@dagrejs/graphlib`).

This crate is intentionally small and focused:

- directed/undirected graph storage
- compound graphs (parent/child)
- multigraph edge keys
- helper algorithms (`dugong_graphlib::alg`)

Baseline revisions are tracked in `repo-ref/REPOS.lock.json` in the repository.
