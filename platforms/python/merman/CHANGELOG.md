# Changelog

All notable changes to the Python package will be documented in this file.

The format is based on Keep a Changelog, and this package follows the merman workspace version.

## Unreleased

### Breaking changes

- Replaced the prerelease ABI 2 text-measurement callback records in place: requests now identify one of 19 exact operations and handled results require the operation's tagged result kind; upgrade the Python wheel and bundled native library together and update custom measurers for operations `0..18`.
- Replaced the TextScan-capable document-facts payload shipped in `0.8.0a3` with the sole parser-only facts schema 1 contract; remove `fact_source: "text_scan"` handling, accept explicit unavailable bodies, and consume parser-backed rename policies.
- Renamed binding option fields `viewport_width` and `viewport_height` to `container_width` and `container_height`, and removed the alpha Flowchart ELK backend selector; update any serialized `options_json` before upgrading.

### Added

- Added generated `ABI_VERSION` and `require_abi_version()` helpers, exact text-measurement operation/result-kind enums, and the expanded diagram-family capability record from the canonical 35-family catalog.

### Changed

- Updated the bundled engine to the Mermaid 11.16 compatibility baseline, including source-backed Swimlane, Cynefin, Railroad, Wardley, and ZenUML behavior plus parser, layout, SVG, theme, Gantt, TreeView, and edge-routing fixes across existing families.
- Host measurement failures, unsupported operations, and wrong-kind results now fall back per operation while reusable engines reject callback re-entry and in-flight measurer replacement.
- Wheels now carry the project license, source-provenance notice, and exact third-party license texts in `.dist-info/licenses`.
