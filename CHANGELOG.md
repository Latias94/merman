All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on *Keep a Changelog*, and this project adheres to *Semantic Versioning*.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Imported additional upstream fixtures from Cypress and package tests (requirement, gantt, ER, flowchart, sequence, state, class) to expand SVG parity coverage.

### Fixed

- Improved `<foreignObject>` readability fallback for raster outputs (PNG/JPG/PDF): remove the white text outline overlay and render a semi-transparent `.labelBkg` background when present (closer to upstream Mermaid defaults).
- Reduced cross-platform SVG DOM drift in `parity-root` compares by snapping root `style` `max-width` and `viewBox` to a stable lattice.
- Aligned C4 `sprite` rendering with upstream Mermaid: only `person`/`external_person` emit `<image>` sprites.
- Reduced churn during `import-upstream-docs --with-baselines` by skipping blank-info code fences that lack an explicit Mermaid diagram directive (e.g. `flowchart` / `graph`).
- Reduced churn during `import-upstream-cypress --with-baselines` by deferring out-of-scope class fixtures (`htmlLabels=false`, `layout=elk`, `look!=classic`) under `fixtures/_deferred/`.
- Improved `import-upstream-pkg-tests` Mermaid source extraction to handle `"..."` / `'...'` literals and template strings with `${...}` interpolation.

### Changed

- Refreshed README showcase renders after parity updates (mindmap examples).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- Headless Mermaid parsing and semantic JSON output (`merman-core`).
- Headless layout + SVG rendering with DOM parity gates against upstream baselines (`merman-render`).
- Ergonomic wrapper crate for UI integrations (`merman`, feature-gated via `render` / `raster`).
- CLI for detection, parsing, layout, and rendering (`merman-cli`).
- Raster outputs (PNG/JPG/PDF) via pure-Rust SVG conversion (`resvg` / `svg2pdf`).
- Golden snapshots and parity tooling (`xtask`, `fixtures/**`, `docs/alignment/STATUS.md`).
- ZenUML headless compatibility mode (subset translated to `sequenceDiagram`; not parity-gated).
- Local performance regression tracking via Criterion (`cargo bench -p merman --features render --bench pipeline`).

### Changed

- SVG renderer implementation is organized under `svg::parity` to reflect the upstream-as-spec intent.
- State diagram root viewport (`viewBox`/`max-width`) defaults to SVG-emitted bounds scanning (closest to browser `getBBox()`); set `MERMAN_STATE_VIEWPORT=layout` to use layout-derived bounds.
